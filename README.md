## Objective

Our goal in this repo is to provide a standard library to run inference for various YOLO models including- detection, oriented bounding boxes, segmentation... and achieve the same results as ultralytics (a pixel here and there).

## Tasks

### Pre/Post Processing 
- [x] Oriented Bouding Boxes
- [ ] Detection 
- [ ] Segmentation

### Refactor 

### Further Speed Boost 

### MOJO?
